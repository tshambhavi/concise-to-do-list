# Concise To-Do List

This to-do list is a variant of a project from <a href='https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/' target='_blank'>Web Developer Bootcamp</a>. The list uses CSS flexbox and JavaScript to render the following functionalities:

- Prompt users to add-tasks if none exist.
- Let users add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks.
- Display an error message if a user tries to add a duplicate task.
- Limit task length to 32 characters so that users focus on brevity and singularity.
- Persist data across browser sessions.
